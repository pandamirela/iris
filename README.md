# Iris (fork of HowdoI.ai) is a reference implementation of a data augmented generative AI.

This is an experiment in building a large-language-model-backed chatbot. It can hold a conversation, remember previous comments/questions, and answer all types of queries (history, web search, movie data, weather, news, and more).

This app relies on the amazing [LangChain Python library](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which powers all the interesting AI stuff.


## Getting API Keys 

For those who want to use this to it's fullest ability you'll need to get API keys.

| Key Name  |  Where to Get It | Works?  |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | https://openai.com | Yes |
| SERPAPI_API_KEY | https://serpapi.com/ | Yes |
| GIPHY_API_KEY | | Todo |
| NEWS_API_KEY | https://newsapi.org | Testing |
| TMDB_API_KEY | https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api | Testing |
| WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APPID https://products.wolframalpha.com/api | Testing |
| GOOGLE_API_KEY https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials | Todo |
| GOOGLE_CSE_ID | ??? | Todo

## Running locally

First, add your API keys in the `.env` file.

Then, install the Python requirements and start the app. You'll want a Procfile manager like [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) or [Hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) installed.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
foreman start -f Procfile.local
```

Once it's running, open up [http://127.0.0.1:9000/](http://127.0.0.1:9000/) and you'll be able to start interacting with the bot. There's also a writing assistant endpoint at [http://127.0.0.1:9000/write](http://127.0.0.1:9000/write).


## Running in Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/xingh/iris)

First, add your API keys in the `.env` file.

Then, install the Python requirements and start the app. You can use a Procfile manager like [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) or [Hivemind](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind) installed. My prerence was to keep it with the Python theme. [Honcho](https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho) is a tool that does the same thing. 

I preppedd the Gitpod this way, but also have added it to the .gitpod.yml
```
pyenv install 3.9
pyenv local 3.9
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install honcho 
```

To fix node/vite issues
```
rm -rf node_modules
cd vite
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf dist/assets/*
npm install -g vite
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
honcho start -f Procfile.local
```

Once it's running, open up [http://127.0.0.1:9000/](http://127.0.0.1:9000/) and you'll be able to start interacting with the bot. There's also a writing assistant endpoint at [http://127.0.0.1:9000/write](http://127.0.0.1:9000/write).

## Deploying

This repository is set up to deploy on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). You should be able to follow [their docs and get it running there very quickly](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/python/).

## Experiments Folder

This folder has a few attempts at generating/testing LLM examples programmatically. You can probably ignore this unless you're just curious.
